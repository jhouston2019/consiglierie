# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Cognitive Console?

A high-intelligence reflective processing system that analyzes your thoughts, decisions, and patterns across four ontological layers: psychological structure, strategic cognition, manifestation/identity assumption, and archetypal interpretation.

### Is this a journaling app?

No. This is a structured cognitive processing system with AI-powered multi-layer analysis and longitudinal pattern tracking.

### Is this therapy?

No. This is a cognitive instrument for self-directed exploration. It is not a substitute for professional mental health care.

## Features

### What are the 6 input modes?

- **Free Write**: Unstructured exploration
- **Question**: Specific inquiry
- **Scenario**: Situation analysis
- **Decision**: Choice evaluation
- **Emotional**: Feeling processing
- **Identity**: Self-concept examination

### What are the 7 active lenses?

- **Adaptive**: Balanced across all layers
- **Strategist**: Strategic cognition emphasis
- **Therapist**: Psychological structure emphasis
- **Philosopher**: Existential meaning emphasis
- **Shadow**: Archetypal integration emphasis
- **Non-Dual**: Observer/observed collapse
- **Manifestation**: Assumption integrity emphasis

### What is Brutal Mode?

An optional high-confrontation mode that:
- Increases directness
- Detects ego patterns explicitly
- Delivers shorter, sharper outputs
- Reduces diplomatic framing

Use when you want maximum honesty without cushioning.

### What are depth levels?

1. **Surface**: Brief, direct observations
2. **Moderate**: Pattern identification
3. **Deep**: Underlying structures
4. **Maximum**: Full ontological stack analysis

Higher depth = more comprehensive analysis.

## Pattern Metrics

### What is Identity Stability Index?

A composite score measuring overall coherence and emotional regulation. Calculated from:
- State drift (inverted)
- Excess importance (inverted)
- Ego defensiveness (inverted)
- Narrative coherence

Higher = more stable identity structure.

### What is Excess Importance?

From Reality Transurfing: Over-attachment to outcomes that creates resistance. When you assign excessive importance to something, you generate opposing forces.

Examples:
- "I NEED this to work"
- "This is CRITICAL to my success"
- "Without this I'm nothing"

### What is Wealth-Identity Fusion?

When self-worth becomes conflated with external achievement or financial success.

Examples:
- "I need money to be happy"
- "Success defines who I am"
- "Without wealth I'm worthless"

### What is the Impatience Index?

Tracks timeline frustration and urgency patterns. Increases when language indicates:
- "Why isn't this happening?"
- "When will I finally..."
- "This is taking too long"

### What is State Drift Frequency?

Measures emotional regulation variance over time. High drift = unstable emotional states across entries.

### What is Narrative Coherence?

Consistency across entries in terms of:
- Mode selection patterns
- Lens usage patterns
- State stability trends

Higher = more consistent self-narrative.

## Manifestation Framework

### What is "Living FROM vs Living TOWARD"?

**Neville Goddard principle:**

- **Living TOWARD**: Desiring from a state of lack
- **Living FROM**: Assuming the identity of having already achieved

The system evaluates assumption integrity and behavioral congruence.

### What is assumption strength?

How coherently you embody your declared identity. High score = strong assumption integrity with behavioral alignment.

### How does the Observer Effect apply?

Your attention shapes your reality tunnel. The system tracks:
- What you focus on
- How you frame experiences
- Where you direct cognitive resources

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data private?

Yes. All data is protected by Row Level Security. Only you can access your entries, responses, and metrics.

### Is my data used for AI training?

No. Your data is never used for AI training purposes.

### Can other users see my entries?

No. There are no public profiles or sharing features.

### Can I delete my data?

Yes. Contact support for complete account deletion.

## Technical

### What AI model is used?

GPT-4 Turbo for multi-layer synthesis.

### How is rate limiting implemented?

20 requests per minute per user. In-memory sliding window.

### Can I export my data?

Not currently implemented. Future feature.

### Is there a mobile app?

No. Web-based only. Responsive design works on mobile browsers.

## Usage

### How often should I use this?

As needed. The system benefits from regular use for pattern tracking, but there's no required frequency.

### What should I write about?

Anything requiring cognitive processing:
- Decisions
- Emotional states
- Identity questions
- Strategic planning
- Pattern recognition
- Manifestation work

### How long should entries be?

No minimum. Maximum 10,000 characters. Write as much as needed for thorough processing.

### Should I use the same lens every time?

No. Different lenses serve different purposes. Experiment to find what works for each situation.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is processing slow?

AI synthesis takes 5-15 seconds depending on depth level and input length.

### Why am I getting rate limited?

You've exceeded 20 requests in one minute. Wait 60 seconds and try again.

### Why can't I sign in?

- Verify email/password correct
- Check email confirmation if required
- Clear browser cookies and retry
- Check Supabase project is active

### Why are metrics not updating?

Metrics update after each entry submission. Refresh dashboard to see latest values.

## Future Features

### Will there be a subscription?

The architecture supports future monetization, but no subscription is currently required.

### Will there be more lenses?

Potentially. The system is designed to support additional lenses as premium features.

### Will there be mobile apps?

Possibly. Current focus is web-based experience.

### Will there be data export?

Planned for future release.
