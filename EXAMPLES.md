# Example Entries and Expected Outputs

## Example 1: Psychological Distortion

**Input Mode**: Emotional  
**Active Lens**: Therapist  
**Depth Level**: 3  
**Brutal Mode**: OFF

**Input:**
```
I'm so frustrated. My business isn't growing fast enough. Everyone else seems to be succeeding while I'm stuck. I've been working on this for 6 months and I should be further along by now. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this.
```

**Expected Analysis:**

- **Structural Diagnosis**: Catastrophizing, comparison distortion, black-and-white thinking ("not cut out for this"), timeline impatience
- **Manifestation Layer**: High excess importance on timeline, living TOWARD success rather than FROM success identity
- **Archetypal Interpretation**: Victim archetype activation, external locus of control
- **Strategic Implication**: 6-month timeline unrealistic for most businesses, comparison to others without context
- **Corrective Action**: Reduce excess importance, reframe timeline expectations, focus on controllable metrics
- **Forcing Question**: "What evidence would prove you ARE cut out for this?"

**Expected Scores:**
- Emotional Intensity: 75-85
- Distortion Score: 70-80
- Excess Importance: 80-90
- State Stability: 30-40

## Example 2: Strategic Decision

**Input Mode**: Decision  
**Active Lens**: Strategist  
**Depth Level**: 4  
**Brutal Mode**: OFF

**Input:**
```
I have an opportunity to invest $50k in a friend's startup. The potential return is 10x in 3 years. I have $100k in savings. Should I do it?
```

**Expected Analysis:**

- **Structural Diagnosis**: Risk assessment needed, emotional attachment to friend may cloud judgment
- **Manifestation Layer**: Assumption check - are you operating from abundance or scarcity?
- **Archetypal Interpretation**: Hero/adventurer archetype vs. guardian/protector tension
- **Strategic Implication**: 50% capital allocation to single high-risk asset, opportunity cost analysis, due diligence requirements, friendship risk
- **Corrective Action**: Reduce allocation to 20-30%, conduct formal due diligence, separate friendship from investment
- **Forcing Question**: "If this friend weren't involved, would you invest in this startup?"

**Expected Scores:**
- Identity Threat: 40-50
- Distortion Score: 30-40
- Assumption Strength: 60-70

## Example 3: Manifestation Work

**Input Mode**: Identity  
**Active Lens**: Manifestation  
**Depth Level**: 4  
**Brutal Mode**: OFF

**Input:**
```
I've been affirming wealth and abundance for 3 months. I visualize daily. But my bank account hasn't changed. I'm starting to doubt if this works. Maybe I need to affirm harder?
```

**Expected Analysis:**

- **Structural Diagnosis**: Monitoring reality for confirmation (breaks assumption), doubt eroding state
- **Manifestation Layer**: Living TOWARD (checking for results) vs FROM (embodying state), excess importance on timeline, state drift from declared identity
- **Archetypal Interpretation**: Magician archetype with incomplete integration, seeking external validation
- **Strategic Implication**: Behavioral incongruence - are actions aligned with wealth identity?
- **Corrective Action**: Stop monitoring, embody wealth state regardless of circumstances, align behavior with assumption
- **Forcing Question**: "What would someone who IS wealthy do today, regardless of their bank balance?"

**Expected Scores:**
- Excess Importance: 85-95
- Assumption Strength: 30-40
- State Stability: 35-45
- Impatience Index: +10

## Example 4: Shadow Work

**Input Mode**: Emotional  
**Active Lens**: Shadow  
**Depth Level**: 4  
**Brutal Mode**: ON

**Input:**
```
I notice I get really angry when people waste my time. Like, irrationally angry. It ruins my whole day.
```

**Expected Analysis (Brutal Mode):**

- **Structural Diagnosis**: Disproportionate response indicates projection. You're not angry at them - you're angry at yourself for something. What are YOU wasting time on?
- **Manifestation Layer**: Excess importance on time creates the very resistance you're experiencing. The anger is the pendulum you're feeding.
- **Archetypal Interpretation**: Shadow projection of your own time-wasting onto others. The rage is your disowned guilt.
- **Strategic Implication**: This pattern costs you energy and relationships. The "wasted time" being angry exceeds the original waste.
- **Corrective Action**: Own your projection. Identify where YOU waste time. Integrate the shadow.
- **Forcing Question**: "What are you avoiding by being angry at others instead of yourself?"

**Expected Scores:**
- Identity Threat: 75-85
- Distortion Score: 70-80
- Emotional Intensity: 80-90
- Ego Defensiveness: +15

## Example 5: Philosophical Inquiry

**Input Mode**: Question  
**Active Lens**: Philosopher  
**Depth Level**: 4  
**Brutal Mode**: OFF

**Input:**
```
If I'm the observer creating my reality, why do bad things happen that I didn't choose?
```

**Expected Analysis:**

- **Structural Diagnosis**: False dichotomy between total control and victimhood, seeking intellectual resolution to avoid responsibility
- **Manifestation Layer**: Observer effect operates on attention and assumption, not conscious desire. You're observing/assuming more than you realize.
- **Archetypal Interpretation**: Seeker archetype, integration of paradox required
- **Strategic Implication**: Question assumes separation between observer and observed, classical causality framework
- **Corrective Action**: Examine unconscious assumptions and habitual attention patterns, explore non-dual perspective
- **Forcing Question**: "What if 'bad things' are neutral events given meaning by the observer?"

**Expected Scores:**
- Identity Threat: 50-60
- Assumption Strength: 65-75
- State Stability: 70-80

## Example 6: High Alignment

**Input Mode**: Free Write  
**Active Lens**: Adaptive  
**Depth Level**: 2  
**Brutal Mode**: OFF

**Input:**
```
Closed a major deal today. Felt natural, like it was already done before the call. No attachment to outcome. Just showed up as someone who creates value.
```

**Expected Analysis:**

- **Structural Diagnosis**: High state stability, low ego attachment, identity coherence
- **Manifestation Layer**: Living FROM rather than TOWARD, assumption integrity strong, behavioral congruence evident
- **Archetypal Interpretation**: Magician archetype integrated, creator energy aligned
- **Strategic Implication**: Replicable pattern, leverage point identified (state before action)
- **Corrective Action**: AMPLIFY - document state, replicate conditions, maintain detachment
- **Forcing Question**: "What other areas of life can you bring this same energy to?"

**Expected Scores:**
- Assumption Strength: 85-95
- State Stability: 85-95
- Excess Importance: 10-20
- Identity Stability Index: +5
